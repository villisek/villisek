###  📻 Music

I listen music **a lot**. My favourite band is the british 🎸 "Dire Straits" band.
You may find my favourite musics playlist [on Tidal](https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/33a37fc8-537d-4e5a-9f2c-dd0e1bf089f2). 

### 🕹️ Video games

I don't play video games a lot, but when I play, I like old J-RPGs, old SNES games in general, and visual novels. 

# 🏗️ Activity on GitHub

I may not be active here, because most of projects I work on are only private/local projects OR projects hosted on independant Git services. 

I hope to meet you soon on a project! Toodaloo!
