I possess a **high degree of adaptability** and **can rapidly delve into and grasp new subjects**, whether they're related to technology, programming languages, or development environments.

My skill set covers a range of languages and technologies. I'm well-versed in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and its statically-typed counterpart **TypeScript** (including proficiency with the **Svelte framework**). Additionally, I am experienced in **PHP**, **Go**, **C/C++** and **C#**.

My knowledge extends to internet networking as well, encompassing internal routing using OSPF and external routing through BGP. I'm skilled in managing Cisco and Ubiquiti routers, as well as BIRD virtual routers. Moreover, I possess hands-on experience in embedded software development, particularly in C/C++ on ESP32 and working with LoRA on Mikrotik gateways, among other areas.

# 🗓️ Leisure Time

I love listening to music. The iconic British 🎸 band "Dire Straits" holds a special place in my heart. In terms of musical preferences, I gravitate towards pop/rock from the 1970s to the 2000s.

### 🕹️ Video Games

While I'm not an avid gamer, I do enjoy indulging in vintage J-RPGs, classic SNES games, and engaging visual novels whenever the opportunity arises.
