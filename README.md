My exam will be in Q2-Q3 2021.

# 🗓️ Sparetime
###  📻 Music

I listen music **a lot**. My favourite band is the british 🎸 "Dire Straits" band.

### 🕹️ Video games

I play few video games. The only ones I play are mostly 16 and 32-bits era games. I really like RPGs, as all my servers are named from characters in games of that genre. I also really like visual novels :-)

# 🏗️ Activity on GitHub

I may not be super-active here, because most of projects I work on are only private/local projects OR projects hosted on independant services. 

I hope to meet you soon on a project! Toodaloo!
