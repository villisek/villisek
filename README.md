Hello folks!

# 🤝🏼 General

I'm a 🇫🇷 French 👨🏼‍🎓 student in **🖳 Computer science and 🖧 networks**. 

# 🎓 Studies

**[Update: I'm waiting for my exam results. There's 99.999% chances I succeed. I'll keep studying, but then to get a license-degree!]**
I'm on the 2nd-year of a "BTS Systèmes numériques" (with the 🥐 accent 😛- equivalent to a technical degree or BTEC). 
My exam will be in Q2-Q3 2021. 

# 💬 Languages

My mother language is 🇫🇷 French, but I can also speak 🇬🇧 English and 🇪🇸 Spanish. I am interested in the 🇯🇵 Japanese language (こんにちは！). 

# 👨🏼‍💻 Technical knowledge

It'd be difficult to give an exhaustive list of what I can do in the digital world, but here are some stuff I can do:
- Create websites in HTML, CSS, JS for the front-end. I'm learning Python and Django for back-end part. I have an old knowledge in PHP but I no longer really want to develop things in that language. 
- I'm learning C and C++ at school. Will also start learning Java in class soon. 
- I can configure Cisco routers for OSPF/RIP routing, I can too configure a NAT, a DHCP server (on Cisco but also with dnsmasq and ISC DHCP server on Linux)
- I can also configure an Ubiquiti EdgeRouter (I use one for my room LAN, with a LAN inside my ISP's router LAN - yeah that's a LAN-ception). 
- I can configure Apache and Nginx webservers on Linux and FreeBSD, along with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases (and I'm not scared by MS-SQL Server!)
- I'm a newbie to BGP (I maintain AS4242420308 on the DN42 Network as VILLISEK-MNT). 
- And much more!

# 🗓️ Sparetime
###  📻 Music

I listen music **a lot**. My favourite band is the british 🎸 "Dire Straits" band.

### 🕹️ Video games

I play few video games. The only ones I play are mostly 16 and 32-bits era games. I really like RPGs, as all my servers are named from characters in games of that genre. 

# 🏗️ Activity on GitHub

I may not be super-active here, because most of projects I work on are only private/local projects OR projects hosted on independant services. 

And now, time for stats!
